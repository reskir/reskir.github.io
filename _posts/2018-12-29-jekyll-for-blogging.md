My experience with jekyll started with simple blog about urbanism and city development (<a href="//urbanistas.lt">https://urbanistas.lt</a>). You can find all source files on github <a href="https://github.com/reskir/urban_blog">github project page</a>.

#### Perks of using Jekyll for your projects:

-   **No backend/databases** (yes, I consider this as pros).
-   **Static files**, all you need is html + css and sometimes some simple javascript logic (for slider f.ex.);
-   **Markdown** - it is easy to document and write posts
-   **Plugins** - jekyll has some awesome plugins for SEO, asset management and etc.
-   **Hosting** - it is easy to host, even github pages can host jekyll website

#### What packages and tools I am using

For my blogs I usually reuse the same plugins, the most useful I found are these:

```json
"jekyll-assets"
"jekyll-seo-tag"
"image_optim"
"image_optim_pack"
"mini_magick"
```
